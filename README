Quick'n'dirty logfile parser and match damage grapher for The Culling


This utility reads the logfile for The Culling at:
  %LOCALAPPDATA%/Victory/Saved/Logs/Victory.log

It renders stats to an HTML file in %TEMP%, then opens
that file for viewing using the default web browser.

TODO:

 - The 'total' column values would probably be more useful if
   tracked player vs. player, instead of showing running totals for
   the whole match.  (Maybe the final totals for the whole match 
   could be footnotes.)
